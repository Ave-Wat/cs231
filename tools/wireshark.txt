5. Synchronize: sends something requesting a transmission
6. Acknowledge: acknowledges the other computer's transmission
7. Finalize: signals end of transmission
8. looking at the ip addresses, the source is the server, and the destination is us. The server requested the FIN

Web Browser Experiment
1. 2 connections (2 TCP SYN requests from home IP address)
2. yes, GET /index.html HTTP/1.1, requested by us from the server
3. yes, GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1, requested by us from the server

===QUESTIONS===
1. how do we use this for security? how does wireshark find vulnerabilities
2. how is an ip address created? what does each number do?
3. how are port numbers created?
