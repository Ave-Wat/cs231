1) What's your computer's IP address for its current Internet connection? (Bonus: how can you tell the difference between your Ethernet IP and your wireless IP if you have both connections active?)

using ipconfig for Windows or ifconfig for Ubuntu: 137.22.181.186

2) How can you determine the IP address associated with a given host name?

nslookup [hostname], (can also use ping?)

3) How can you determine the host name(s) associated with a given IP address?

nslookup [ipaddress], (can also use ping?)

4) How can you copy a file from one computer to another? Or more to the point, if you create a file on the Kali virtual machine and you want to put it someplace where you can save it, like your your Math/CS account on mantis.mathcs.carleton.edu, how do you go about it from the Kali command-line interface?

tried using scp, had to download PuTTY for Windows to use pscp.
pscp -P 22 afish@127.0.0.1:/home/afish/Documents/tocopy.txt copy.txt created error: FATAL ERROR: Network error: Connection refused

local to remote: scp file.txt remote_username@[remote ip]:/remote directory
remote to local: scp remote_username@[remote ip]:/remote/file.txt /local/directory

5) How can you tell whether there's a process listening on a given port (e.g. port 80 or port 22) on a given host?

netstat

6) How can you tell which ports have processes listening on them on a given host?

netstat -a -b (can add -n to make faster) or netstat -aon | find /i "listening"
need to run as administrator to do this

7) How can you retrieve and save a given web page (say http://google.com/ or http://carleton.edu/) in a file on your system?

curl [url] > [download filename].txt

8) How can you view the HTTP headers sent back from a specified web server when you request one of its pages?

curl -i [url]

9) [Super bonus question] Is there a command-line-only way to view the HTTP headers that *my* computer sends when I run the commands in the previous two questions?


*NOTE: can display all recent computer web connections with ipconfig /displaydns and can remove with ipconfig /flushdns
